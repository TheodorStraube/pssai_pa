Parameters:  
initial_temperature - Initial temperature for simulated annealing  
frozen_temperature - Abort temperature for simulated annaeling  
cooling_ratio - Rate of temperature decrease  
iterations - Number of iterations per cooling step  
initial_method - How to generate initial solution. Either "random" or "trivial"  
neighbor_method - How to generate neighborhood. "far" swaps any two operations on a machine,  
		"near" only swaps adjacent operations
